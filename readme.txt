Create WordPress posts via REST API with custom SEO fields, image uploads, primary category assignment, and integration with popular SEO plugins (SEOPress, Yoast SEO, and Rank Math).

== Description ==

The WPRaiz Content API Tool is a powerful plugin that enables the creation of WordPress posts programmatically through a REST API. Ideal for developers and websites that need seamless content integration from external systems, this plugin supports:

- **Integration with Major SEO Plugins**: Set custom SEO fields for titles and descriptions, compatible with SEOPress, Yoast SEO, and Rank Math.
- **Flexible Image Uploads**: Accept images via URL or Base64 encoding, with automatic attachment as the featured image.
- **Automatic Category Management**: Assign an existing category or create a new one based on supplied category names.
- **Installation Check Endpoint**: Verify plugin installation, authentication, and detect the installed SEO plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file.
2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click on **Upload Plugin** and choose the zip file you downloaded.
4. Click **Install Now** and activate the plugin.
5. Use the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/api-post-creator/v1/create-post` to start creating posts programmatically.

== Authentication ==

To authenticate API requests, you must use an application password, which can be generated from your user profile in the WordPress admin dashboard.

1. **Generate Application Password**: Go to **Users > Profile** in the WordPress dashboard and create an application password.
2. **Authorization Header**: Pass the application password in a Base64-encoded `Authorization` header in the format `Basic {base64_encode(username:application_password)}`.
